## The role introduction

I work as frontend research developer in risk frontend team which is lead by CJ.  
The main part of this role is maintain/develop frontend part of several projects, like adminUI, RiskAdminUI and more.  
As a member of Risk department, we focus on risk related sections of each project,  
but not limit, sometimes when the features need other teams' api or components, we still have chances to work with developers from other teams of course.

As the first line facing users, "How to help users get their goals." and "How to help them when they got lost." is the most important things that we going to do.  
Not only developing features, but also figure out what's going on when facing some "historical" bugs.  
Sometimes it will be a little bit hard to sorting the old codes, but in the process, it still have something we can learn from it.

In next section I will introduce the main modules of each project that I ever/still worked for.

#### 1. AdminUI

AdminUI, aka PNK project, which has soooo many modules and even we only count Risk related parts, they still have a lot of codes.  
It takes me a lot of time to figure it out what behavior of each pages and does it have some potential situations that I may miss.  
And here are the modules that I spent my time most:

##### 1-1. Withdraw/Outgo Report/Audit Pages

Withdraw and Outgo report/audit pages are the first project that I touch. When I get into the page first time, I can't even tell what's the difference between withdraw and outgo. Both of them have list page and detail page, and the codes looks quite the same and even the naming of function are very similar.  
After few days and few features and bugfix, I think I can tell not only the business part, but also some potential details hidden in codes.

But maintaining this kind of codes is not easy, for ourselves and for others,  
PM is planning to restructure these pages, including codes part, in the visible future I think it will have a brand new Withdraw/Outgo pages may expect.

##### 1-2. Case Manually Mark Pages

Case manually mark, aka "Case Center" or just "CMM" for short, is the biggest module that I ever develop in Binance.  
It has same problem with Withdraw/Outgo report page: complex logic, huge amount of codes.

Step by step, start with small features like update table's key and filters of search bar,  
for now we're just finished a basically totally different case property called "Batch Register".  
We spend a lot of time on meeting and coding, it's so nice that we finished it.

But we're not going to stop here, PM just planned another huge scale of restructure of ALL case properties.  
It's an exciting thing, 'cause finally we have planned time and testing to sort/prune the 5000 lines codes ðŸŽ‰.
Though I know it won't be easy, but I think it will be another amazing journey.

> This module Case Manually Mark is handover to Kevin-lll. I hope he won't hate my codes in the future.

##### 1-3. Chargeback Pages

Not like withdraw/outgo and case manually mark, module Chargeback is totally a different business stuff with others.  
It doesn't have any audit flow, the basic flow of this page is let operator pick some data they needed and according of them to generate a report,  
then operator may use this report to explain to other companies like bank that Binance position to avoid any potential misunderstanding.

To sorting the business stuff and make them into codes is not an easy thing, but compare with CMM or withdraw/outgo audit, due to the codes amount compare with them is not that terrifying. I may have more flexible way to develop it.
For now the features and details of this page is getting more and more, how to maintain and don't let the next developer hate us is the most important things.

#### 2. RiskAdminUI & BBDS

Not only AdminUI, I also develop some features and bugfix of project RiskAdminUI and BBDS.  
But in both project I didn't have that much experience yet. so I won't introduce them these projects that much.

I just started a new module in RiskAdminUi, named "ChargeIt". Work with coworker in different timezone and use English in every contact/meeting is the biggest challenge of it.

## The achievement

Not only develop new features, sorting old codes is also a satisfied thing for programmer.  
Maybe it cannot have a measurable result, but I think it's also an important thing that I did in pass half year.

As I know some codes of our frontend modules were not developed by frontend developer, in this case, as a frontend developer and kind of good at this part,  
I think it's a necessary thing to review the codes to reduce the loading of every features in futures.  
Fortunately, the hardest modules that I ever touched in binance have the plan to do the restructure things, and one of them, Case Manually Mark, you can say that we're already on the half of way there almost.

I can say that our codes are getting stronger and we do will save so much time in the future.  
We have more flexible and readable codes, and when the day has come, we can handover it proudly.

Except that, normal features and bugfix are also important, I think we do have accumulate something. and we can't get to Rome in one day.

### The findings or learning (if proper)

Not only the crypto things, as a developer, the weekly meeting of frontend team shared a lot of geek tech that I not ever deep get into it.  
And as a remote worker, I also learn a brand new lifestyle to balance work and live, that's interesting.

### The future OKR or working plan

As the above said, couple weeks ago I took over and in charge a new module in RiskAdminUI(DecisionHub), in this module I have to work with coworker in totally different timezone and use English in every meeting and discuss.  
I got to say that it's a great challenge for me 'cause I don't really have that much experience using English to express my points or even discuss with other programmer.

Thanks the patient of backend mate Raj, the first meeting is not that bad I guess.  
And thanks my team leader CJ, he also helps me a lot.

Maybe after more features development and conversation, I hope I can become a more globally developer and when I get that level, I think I may have way more different views and thoughts of everything and do will have more opportunities.

And before that, I will do my best.
